    This sequence template is part 2 for comparing and updating champi based mods. As of last month, he confirmed he doesn't
    individually package his mods anymore. Therefore, we must get them by extracting from his installer -.-
    This part picks up by stopping the compare.

    Required macros:
    {working_folder_package}       - The working folder of the final package output
    {upload_zip_filename}          - The name of the zipfile to exist on the server, without file extension
  -->
  <TaskDefinitions>

    <!-- create the new zip
      "a" is to add to an archive. In this case because it's the first file, the archive is created for the first time.
      -tzip is to create a zip format archive
      -mx=9 is setting the level of compression to 9 (scale goes from 0 [store] to 9[ultra])
      -r recurse subdirectories
