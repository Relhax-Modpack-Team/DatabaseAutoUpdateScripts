    <!-- compare the hashes. this is done in 3 steps:
      1. write the compare_start task (resets the internal counters for matches and differences)
      2. use compare tasks to compare files on disk or an entry in a zip file
      3. write the compare_end task (evaluates the counts from the compare tasks)
          if compare_end finds 0 differences, then the automation process will end early (nothing to update)

      By using the directory_compare task, if the number of swf's change between the modpack and source, something has changed in the structure and we need to account for it

      "a" is to add to an archive. In this case because it's the first file, the archive is created for the first time.
      -tzip is to create a zip format archive
      -mx=9 is setting the level of compression to 9 (scale goes from 0 [store] to 9[ultra])
      -r recurse subdirectories
      NOTE: this will include everything in the working directory
