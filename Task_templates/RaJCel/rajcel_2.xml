    This sequence template is part 2 for comparing and updating RaJCel mods.
    This part picks up by stopping the compare, and ends at creating and uploading the zip file.
    - extract patches from modpack to package, if exist
    - create {upload_zip_filename} macro for later use in task <create_upload_zip>

    Required macros:
    {working_folder_modpack}       - The working folder of the modpack zip file and extraction processes
    {working_folder_package}       - The working fodler of the final zip file package created to be uploaded
