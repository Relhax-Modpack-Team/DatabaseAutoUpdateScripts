    This sequence template is for comparing all swf files, with checking for if the source # of swfs change.
    Required macros:
    {working_folder_modpack}     - the working directory for all operations involving the modpack side of the files
    {working_folder_source}      - the working directory for all operation involving the source side of the files

    <!-- compare the hashes. this is done in 3 steps:
      1. write the compare_start task (resets the internal counters for matches and differences)
      2. use compare tasks to compare files on disk or an entry in a zip file
      3. write the compare_end task (evaluates the counts from the compare tasks)
          if compare_end finds 0 differences, then the automation process will end early (nothing to update)

      By using the directory_compare task, if the number of swf's change between the modpack and source, something has changed in the structure and we need to account for it
